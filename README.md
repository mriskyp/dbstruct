# dbstruct
dbstruct is a builder to generate column name db from postgres, mysql table into auto generated struct golang

# How to implement this


import to your code
```
go get github.com/mriskyp/dbstruct
```



make sure you have setup generate.yml which consists:
```
generate-dbstruct:
  dbHost : somehost
  dbPort : 3306
  dbName : somedbname
  dbUser : someuser
  dbPassword : somepassword
  dbType : somedbtype
  tableName : somedbtablename
```
 
after that, running main.go to complete the process. your autogenerated struct will be show as output
  
## Dependencies
github.com/ghodss/yaml
github.com/lib/pq
github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql

be careful, instead of passing sql.NullString, we want you to also implement null.String from package guregu 

simply just get the package
```
go get gopkg.in/guregu/null.v3
```
